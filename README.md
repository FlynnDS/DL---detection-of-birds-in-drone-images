## Steps to be taken by our group (Done By monday)
- Baseline model of current data with Yolo - Research papers about what is useful (Eugene)
- Preprocessing & data understanding (Mathijs)
    - Shuffling data is probably necessary since same kind of images seem to be clustered. For example, same kind of agriculture or the same field
- 
- Data collection of open source data - Research available frameworks (Mehdi & Cas & Flynn)
- Explore TuE computing environment 

## Second stage
- Optimizing the baseline
- Experimentation of the different suggested models
-
