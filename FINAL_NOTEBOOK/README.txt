# Deep learning Assignment 2
Welcome to our second Deep Learning assignment. The code can be found in `Assignment 2.ipynb`. 

## How to run the notebook
It consists of the following 'chapters':
- Imports
- Gamma Correction
- Image Slicing
    - Executing the slicing
- Bird Generation
    - Executing the bird generation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Best Model
- Inference

Bird generation requires Apple tools, so if you do not have an Apple device, you cannot run it. More on that in the notebook.

For inference, you'll have to run Imports, Gamma Correction, Image Slicing without Executing the Slicing and Inference.

To execute image slicing, you'll have to create a 'data' folder and 'yolo_data' subfolder, and place data in YOLO format there.
