    "In this project, the task is to determine the birds and their location inside a picture. Birds can be of many differnt shapes and forms, so it is important to have a generalizable model. Secondly, it is critical that the model can make predictions in a tractable manner. It should be fast enough to have the model running on inference on the drone's hardware. For that reason, the model can't be large and complex, it should be lightweight and apaptable. "

    "An issue I have with the data is that I want to use apple's background removing feature but because of the file names. That are super long and complex as they are hashes, it gets confused because the hash potentially mimics a hash that is protected or another reason. So the best appraoch is to clean the file names. But I don't want to do that as it seems cumbersome as my whole code is already great as it is now. "
